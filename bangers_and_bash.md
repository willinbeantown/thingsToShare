# Bangers & Bash

When I first started programming my peers kept asking me about my aliases and bash profile. I had NO idea what they were talking about because, let's be honest, most aspects of programming are a mystery until you have to use them. There are SO many different tools and every experienced programmer has their own way of doing things. Add to that the jargon new programmers, myself included, are often left scratching their heads and hunting Google for answers (and eventually learning to read the SECOND answer on Stack Overflow).

Needless to say, I eventually learned was Bash is, or at least to understand what it does. Bash is a scripting language one can use to execute various commands. Using an interactive login shell (Terminal or iTerm on MacOS have this setting for instance) a sequence of 'hidden' scripts (aka dotfiles which can be shown with the command **ls -a**) run.

A SUPER handy thing to do in ANY script you write is to add comments. For single line comments you can use an octothorpe, **#**. If you want to explain things a bit more you can use a block comment as show here:

> <<COMMENT<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this method you can go into detail about different aspects of your various **.bash*** and **.profile** scripts.<br><br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is handy if you're like me and sometimes forget why you did certain things.<br>
>COMMENT


You can learn more about Bash [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/). You can find some useful aliases and functions [here](https://fxdata.cloud/tutorials/useful-bash-aliases-and-functions). I also found Stefaan Lippens' articles on the subject helpful, which you can find [here](https://www.stefaanlippens.net/my_bashrc_aliases_profile_and_other_stuff/]).
