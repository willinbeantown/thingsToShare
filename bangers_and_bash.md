# Zangers and Zsh
~~# Bangers & Bash~~

Thank you self and Apple for forcing me to learn something new. I love my automatic updates, but I need to get better about reading up on them. Ah well... 

## Now I use [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).

When I first started programming my peers kept asking me about my aliases and bash profile. I had NO idea what they were talking about because, well, let's be honest, most aspects of programming are a mystery until you have to use them. There are SO many different tools as well, and every person is a unique programmer. They each have their own way of doing things. Add to that the jargon of an industry and new programmers are often left scratching their heads and hunting Google for answers. Always read the **second** answer on Stack Overflow!

I eventually learned was Bash is, or at least to understand what it does. Bash is a scripting language one can use to execute various commands. Using an interactive login shell (Terminal or iTerm on MacOS have this setting for instance) a sequence of 'hidden' scripts (aka dotfiles which can be shown with the command **ls -a**) run. But Bash is old, and the latest MacOS is not. Per [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/4/18651872/apple-macos-catalina-zsh-bash-shell-replacement-features), "Apple hasn’t explained exactly why it’s making this change, but bash isn’t exactly a modern shell as it’s implemented in macOS, and a switch to something less aging makes a lot more sense for the company."

A SUPER handy thing to do in ANY script you write is to add comments. For single line comments you can use an octothorpe, **#**. If you want to explain things a bit more you can use a block comment as show here:

> <<COMMENT<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this method you can go into detail about different aspects of your various **.bash*** and **.profile** scripts.<br><br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is handy if you're like me and sometimes forget why you did certain things.<br>
>COMMENT
