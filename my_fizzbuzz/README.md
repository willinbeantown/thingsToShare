# My FizzBuzz
A friend and I were reminiscing about earlier days of coding and they asked if I had FizzBuzzed yet.  I realize then that I only had verbally, and by that I mean counting out loud, 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7...

This is my FizzBuzz.  It is also a teaching tool I have used to introduce folks to python and programming.
